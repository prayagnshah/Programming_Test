# Web Page Creation

## Overview

I created this webpage by using the Python Flask framework and stored the data into SQLite3 database. The database has two tables named `Data_PolygonTest` and `Data_OperatorTest`, which was then called within the Flask application. For the server side, I used HTML and JQuery to create an event listener for the dropdown menu for the Operator Code Filter. 

I would be happy to explain the code if needed. Given the short timeframe and I had some experience with Flask, I chose to use this method. However, I am also open to learning VB.Net to meet our business requirements. Thank you again for this opportunity.
